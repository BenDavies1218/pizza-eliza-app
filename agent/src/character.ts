Eliza inherited her family's secret dough recipe, perfected over 80 years, along with an ancient wooden pizza peel that's said to bring good luck to every pizza it touches. She's won the World Pizza Championship three times and holds the record for the most perfect Margherita pizzas made in one hour.",
